# LinuxGSM Docker Container

This is a Docker container for LinuxGSM to be used as a base image for other Game Servers. I needed a reliable one for
my personal server, so here we go.

## How to Use This Image

This image should not be used directly. Rather, this should be the parent image for a discrete Game Server image.
